Hello World!

Wow, what a great day to be alive.  This is my first blog post!

I have learned how to quickly deploy a blog using Jekyll and Github Pages, all from the browser.  However, I would like to get more hands on experience with the technologies used, and will transition to local development.  That is to say, this blog will have a very short lifespan before I decide to replace it.
